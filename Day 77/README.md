**SSL** vs **TLS** vs **HTTPS** vs **SSH** :

1. **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**:
   - **Purpose**: SSL is an older cryptographic protocol used to ensure secure data transfer between two parties (e.g., your browser and a website server).
   - **Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity:** Provides encryption, authentication, and data integrity.
   - **Example Use Case**: When you visit a website with a URL starting with "https://," SSL secures the connection, displaying the familiar green padlock icon in your browser¹.

2. **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**:
   - **Successor**: TLS is the updated version of SSL.
   - **Security Enhancements**: TLS addresses vulnerabilities found in SSL.
   - **Versions**: TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 exist.
   - **Widely Used**: Websites use TLS (often referred to as SSL/TLS) for secure communication (e.g., HTTPS)³.

3. **HTTPS**:
   - **Definition**: HTTPS stands for "HTTP Secure."
   - **Usage**: It's not a separate protocol but rather HTTP over SSL/TLS.
   - **Purpose**: HTTPS ensures secure data exchange between your browser and a web server.
   - **Example**: When you shop online or log in to your bank account, you're using HTTPS⁴.

4. **SSH (Secure Shell)**:
   - **Purpose**: SSH creates secure tunnels for remote access to other computers (e.g., web servers).
   - **Authentication:** Requires either a username/password or cryptographic public/private keys.
   - **Use Cases**: You can issue commands, transfer files, and manage servers via SSH. For instance, connecting to a server using WP-CLI or SFTP¹.

SSL/TLS secures data transfer, while SSH lets you issue commands remotely.
