<h1> Explanation of terms used in this program </h1>
<p>
<h2>- `let`:</h2> This keyword is used to declare a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

<h2>- `for`:</h2> The `for` keyword is used to create a `for` loop, which consists of three optional expressions (initialization, condition, final-expression), enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.

<h2>- `if`:</h2> The `if` keyword is used to specify a block of code to be executed if a specified condition is true.

<h2>- `continue`:</h2> The `continue` statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.

<h2>- `alert`:</h2> The `alert()` function displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. It's a part of Window interface and is generally used for testing purposes.

<h2>- `==`:</h2> This is a comparison operator in JavaScript, which compares the equality of two operands without considering their type.

<h2>- `=`:</h2> This is an assignment operator, which assigns the value of the right operand to its left operand.

<h2>- `<=`:</h2> This is a comparison operator that checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

<h2>- `i` and `j`:</h2> These are variables used in the code. In this context, `i` is used as a counter for the outer loop, and `j` is used as a counter for the inner loop.

<h2>- `n`:</h2> This is a variable that holds the value up to which you want to check for prime numbers.

<h2>- `nextPrime`:</h2> This is a label for the outer loop. It's used in conjunction with the `continue` statement to skip to the next iteration of the outer loop when a number is found to be not prime.
