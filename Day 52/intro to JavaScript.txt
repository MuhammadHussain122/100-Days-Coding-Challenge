  - Developed into an independent language with its own specification, ECMAScript.

- Execution Environments
  - Can run in any environment with a JavaScript engine.
  - Browsers have embedded engines with various codenames like V8 (Chrome, Opera, Edge) and SpiderMonkey (Firefox).

- Engine Mechanics
  - compiles scripts to machine code.
  - Optimize machine code during execution.

- Capabilities in Browsers
  - Can manipulate webpages, interact with users, and communicate with servers.
  - Limited by safety restrictions to protect users' data and privacy.

- Restrictions in Browsers
  - Cannot access the file system or OS functions directly.
  - Subject to the Same Origin Policy to prevent data theft between different domains.

- Uniqueness of JavaScript
  - Fully integrates with HTML/CSS.
  - Simple tasks are easily accomplished.
  - Universally supported across major browsers.

- Languages Over JavaScript
  - New languages like TypeScript can be transpiled to JavaScript.
  - Transpilation allows coding in other languages while leveraging JavaScript's capabilities.
