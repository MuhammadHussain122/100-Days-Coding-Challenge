## Tuple Data Type In TypeScript:

A tuple is a data type in TypeScript that is similar to an array but has a fixed number of elements, and you can specify the types of each element at specific positions within the tuple.

## Keypoints:

- A tuple is a special type of array with a fixed number of elements.
- Each element in the tuple has a known and specific type.
- The types of elements do not have to be the same.
- Tuples are defined like this: `let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];`
- Tuples are initialized like this: `ourTuple = [12, true, 'Code'];`
- The order of elements matters in tuples. Initializing in the wrong order will throw an error.
- Tuples can be made readonly to prevent modification: `const readonlyTuple: readonly [number, boolean, string] = [1, true, 'code']`;
- TypeScript supports named tuples for providing context for values at each index: `const graph: [x: number, y: number, z] = [43.1, 39.3, 40.2];`
- Tuples are useful for grouping together values of different types in a structured manner.
