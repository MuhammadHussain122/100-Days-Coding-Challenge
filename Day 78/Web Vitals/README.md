## What are Web Vitals?

Metrics for delivering user experience on the web. Used to measure real-world user experience.
**Key Expects:**
**loading performance**, **interactivity**, and **visual stability**.
Site owners use web vitals to provide quality of experience to users and identify opportunities for improvement.
**Core Web Vital:**

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within **2.5 seconds** of when the page first starts loading.
2. **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: INP measures interactivity. For a good user experience, pages should have an INP of **200 milliseconds or less**.
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: CLS measures visual stability. To ensure a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of **0.1 or less**.

Google recommends that site owners use these to improve user experience and achieve success in search results.
