## Enums in TypeScript:

- Enums are a feature in TypeScript that allows you to define a set of named constants.

- There are three types of enums:
  1. Numeric Enums: Initialized with numeric values. By default, the first value is assigned '0', and subsequent values increment by '1'. 
  2. String Enums: Use string literals as values. They are more readable and expressive.
  3. Heterogeneous Enums: Mix numeric and string members in an enum, but it's not recommended.

- Each enum member can be either constant-initialized or computed.
  - Constant-initialized members have fixed values (numeric or string literals).
  - Computed members can be based on expressions or function calls.

- Enums help you create a set of distinct cases and make your code more readable.

- Choose between numeric and string enums based on your specific use case.
