1). Introduction to TypeScript:
- TypeScript is a statically typed programming language built on top of JavaScript. It provides type safety, reducing unexpected behavior in JavaScript. 
- TypeScript introduces static typing, a feature that requires developers to specify variable types upon declaration, similar to languages like C++, C#, and Java. 
- TypeScript is versatile and can be used in various settings, from frontend web development to backend server-side scripting. 
- Learning TypeScript is beneficial due to its high industry demand, its ability to simplify complex JavaScript, its efficiency in reducing the need for extensive 
  unit testing, its capability to prevent errors and provide quick feedback, and its seamless integration with JavaScript. 
  Moreover, TypeScript enhances popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular with advanced features such as interfaces, 
  generics, and decorators.

2). TypeScript setup process:
1. Install Git: Download and install from the official Git website.
2. Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Download and install from the official VSCode website.
3. Install Node.js: Download the LTS or Current version from the official Node.js website and follow the installation instructions.
4. Verify Node.js Installation: Optionally, run "node -v" in the terminal to check the installed Node.js version.
5. Install TypeScript: Use npm to install TypeScript globally with "npm install -g typescript", then verify the installation with "tsc -v".
6. Create Your First Application: Make a new folder, add an "index.ts" file with code, and fix any VS Code warnings.
7. Running the Code: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript with "tsc", then run the JavaScript file with "node filename.js".
8. Project Configuration: Structure the project with a "src" folder, move "index.ts" into it, and generate a "tsconfig.json" file with "tsc --init".
9. Customize tsconfig.json: Optionally, edit "tsconfig.json" to set "rootDir" and "outDir" paths.
10. Compile TypeScript Code: Compile using `tsc` with the settings from "tsconfig.json".
11. Run Compiled JavaScript Code: Execute the compiled JavaScript with "node dist/filename.js".
