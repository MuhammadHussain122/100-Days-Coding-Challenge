1. ## What is DNS?

   DNS, or the Domain Name System, is like a phonebook for the internet. It translates human-friendly domain names (like "example.com") into IP addresses (like "192.0.2.1") that computers use to communicate.
   When you enter a domain name in your browser, DNS helps find the corresponding IP address so you can access the website. It's a crucial part of how the internet works!

2. ## What is DHCP?
   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Its purpose is to automatically assign IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network.
Hereâ€™s how it works:
**_Client-Server Architecture:_**
DHCP operates in a client-server model. When a device connects to the network, it requests a set of parameters from a central DHCP server.
**_Automatic Configuration:_**
DHCP eliminates the need for manual configuration. It dynamically allocates IP addresses from a pool and reclaims them when no longer in use.
**_IPv4 and IPv6:_**
DHCP services exist for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The IPv6 version is commonly called DHCPv6.
**_Advantages:_**
DHCP simplifies network management, especially in large networks, by streamlining IP address assignment.
