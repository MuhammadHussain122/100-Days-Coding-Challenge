/*  Making a Student Template:
Create a blueprint for student information, including their name, age, and the classes they're taking, and
then fill in this blueprint with an example student.

Explain & TIP:
This blueprint, called an interface, helps ensure all students have the same kind of information, making
your code more organized.
