The TypeScript features ("Union Types", "Literal Types", "Nullable Types", "Type Alias", and "Intersection Type") are essential for creating robust and type-safe applications.

- Union Types: Allow variables to hold values of multiple types, providing flexibility in variable assignments.
- Literal Types: Enable strict type checking by allowing variables to hold only specific values, enhancing type safety.
- Nullable Types: Permit variables to be explicitly set to "null", accounting for the possibility of absent or undefine 
  values.
- Type Alias: Provide a way to create our own custom names for types, improving code readability and maintainability.
- Intersection Type: Combine multiple types into one, creating a new type with all properties of the combined types.
