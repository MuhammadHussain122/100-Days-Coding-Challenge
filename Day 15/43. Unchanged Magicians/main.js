Start with your work from Exercise 42. Call the
function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the
original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array.
Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original
names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.
