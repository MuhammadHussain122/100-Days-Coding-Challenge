/*  Cars:
Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
color or an optional feature.
Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was
stored correctly.
