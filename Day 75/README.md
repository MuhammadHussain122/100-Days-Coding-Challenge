**Internet Fundamentals**

- **What is the Internet?**
  The Internet is a vast global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols.

- **Information Movement**
  Data moves across the Internet in bits via mediums like Ethernet cables, fiber optics, and Wi-Fi.

- **Network Communication and Protocols**
  Networks communicate using protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol) for addressing and DNS (Domain Name System) for translating domain names to IP addresses.

- **Packets, Routers, and Reliability**
  Data is sent in packets, which may take various routes to their destination, ensuring reliability even if a path is disrupted.

- **HTTP and HTML**
  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer webpages, which are written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), from servers to browsers.

- **Secure Information Transfer**
  Cryptography, including SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), encrypts data to secure communication over the Internet.

- **Cybersecurity and Internet Crimes**
  Cybersecurity involves measures to protect against cybercrimes such as hacking, phishing, and other malicious activities.
