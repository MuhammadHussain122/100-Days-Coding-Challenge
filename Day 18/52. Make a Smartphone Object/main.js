/* Make a Smartphone Object:
Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand, model, and other key features
like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.

Explain & TIP: Just like a box can contain smaller boxes, objects can contain other objects. This helps organize related
information neatly.
